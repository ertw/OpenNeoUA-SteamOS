# OpenNeoUA

OpenNeoUA is an independent, open-source and non-commercial evolution of the
`UA_source`/OpenUA engine for **Urban Assault**. It modernizes real engine
limitations while preserving vanilla data, levels, scripts, saves and the
original game feeling. A legitimate copy of the original game data is still
required to play.

The project is derived from the upstream `Marisa-Chan/UA_source` lineage and
keeps that provenance visible. Microsoft, TerraTools and the other rights
holders are not affiliated with or endorsing this project. Existing credits and
notices remain applicable.

# Building OpenNeoUA on Modern Windows (64-bit MSYS2):

1. Download and install MSYS2:
https://www.msys2.org/

2. Open MSYS2 MSYS

3. Run:
pacman -Syu for updating.
If MSYS2 asks you to close the terminal, close it and reopen it before continuing.

4. Install all required dependencies:
pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_image mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_ttf mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_net mingw-w64-x86_64-openal mingw-w64-x86_64-libvorbis mingw-w64-x86_64-ffmpeg mingw-w64-x86_64-lua

5. Download the source code ZIP from:
https://github.com/TeuZzZ-17/OpenNeoUA


6. Extract the project folder to your Desktop.
Example:
C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\OpenNeoUA

7. Open the MinGW64 environment with MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit
or directly:
C:\msys64\mingw64.exe

8. In MinGW64 go to the project folder
Example:
cd /c/Users/YourName/Desktop/OpenNeoUA

9. Configure the project:
cmake -B build -S src

10. Compile the project:
cmake --build build -j12

11. If compilation succeeds, you will find:
build/OpenNeoUA.exe

12. Obtain an original copy of Urban Assault:
Use a clean, unmodified installation of the original game.

13. Copy the following into your Urban Assault installation folder:
    
OpenNeoUA.exe,
res,
fonts,
locale/language.lng

15. If OpenNeoUA.exe reports missing DLL files at startup:
Copy the required DLLs from:
C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
into the same folder as:
OpenNeoUA.exe

16. After this step, build/OpenNeoUA.exe should be portable and runnable outside the MSYS2 environment.

# Native Linux / Steam Deck

The Linux build is a native `x86_64` overlay. It does not include Urban Assault
data. Requires Docker. Do not use Proton.

## Build the overlay

```sh
./packaging/steamrt4/local_ci.py
```

Extract the archive into a writable Urban Assault installation:

```sh
tar -xJf build/local-ci/artifacts/OpenNeoUA-steamrt4-x86_64-*.tar.xz \
  -C "/path/to/Urban Assault"
```

## Add it to Steam

1. Steam → Add a Game → Add a Non-Steam Game → browse to `OpenNeoUA.sh` in the
   Urban Assault folder. Name the shortcut **OpenNeoUA**.
2. Leave Compatibility off.
3. Enable Steam Input. Import `SteamInput/openneoua_deck_default.vdf`, or select
   **OpenNeoUA Deck Default** if it is already listed.
4. In-game **Input Settings**, enable **Joystick**. Leave **Alt Joystick** off.

If Game Mode will not start `OpenNeoUA.sh`, point the shortcut at
`bin/OpenNeoUA` and set **Start In** to the Urban Assault directory.

To publish the layout, export it from that shortcut in Steam as
**OpenNeoUA Deck Default**.

## Private Steam Deck AppImage (local only)

Builds an AppImage from a locally owned `UA-Complete/Urban Assault.iso`. Game
data never enters CI.

```sh
./packaging/steamrt4/build_steamdeck.py \
  --assets-dir UA-Complete \
  --output-dir build/steamdeck-private/artifacts
```

`chmod +x` the AppImage and copy it to the Deck. Saves live in
`~/.local/share/OpenNeoUA`.
